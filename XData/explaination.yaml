- everything centers around nodes:
    - every value (including comments) are nodes
    - every node must have a json representation that doesn't loose any information
    - every node can know where it is in a file (line number, character number)
    - nodes can be found in different contexts
    - these are the valid contexts: [ "topLevel", "key", "referenceEvaulation", "restOfLineValue", "spanningLinesValue", "indentedValue" ]
    - nodes can have different forms/styles
    - nodes can contain other nodes
- converters change the nodes:
    - string (xdata) to node
    - node to xdata string
    - node to json
    - json to node
    - validate/verify nodes (certain forms of nodes/formats  are only valid in certain contexts)
