- TODO:
    - finish inlineValueToNode (add adjective)

- everything centers around nodes:
    - every value (including comments) are nodes
    - every node must have a json representation that doesn't loose any information
    - nodes can be found in different contexts (named contexts)
    - nodes can have different forms/styles
    - nodes can contain other nodes
    - nodes can contain tokens, which is just a wrapper around a string
- converters change the nodes:
    - string (xdata) to node
    - node to xdata string
    - node to json
    - json to node
    - validate/verify nodes (certain forms of nodes/formats  are only valid in certain contexts)
