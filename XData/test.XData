introduction: "
    This is a double quote string
    This intro is for the $projectName project
    I can also use C-style escapes like \t and \n here

# block-string literal
literalIntroduction: '
    This is a single quote string
    This intro is for the $projectName project
    C-style escapes don't work at all \t and \n
    however I type here, is exactly how its going to show up

'''this is triple single quotes he said 'thats what she said'''': thing

"things to consider":
    - can't use dot syntax because of decimal numbers, maybe use @ instead
    - using - instead of -
    - adding keywords instead of @true
    - having a way to indicate an empty list or empty mapping
    - is the string-block syntax jarring
    - using (infinite) as an alternative to @infinite
    - trailing newlines
    - add a pseudo end-of-line string kind
