From the parsers point of view, there's only a few things in the language

# Concepts:
- ignored (whitespace and comments)
- punctuation (parenthese, colon, square brackets)
- custom (keywords)
- literals (strings, numbers, atoms,)
- items (object/variables/functions)
- operators (syntatical sugar for functions)
